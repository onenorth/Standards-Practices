#### UI  Select dropdowns

- [Chosen](https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen) - Chosen is a library for making long, unwieldy select boxes more friendly

## Making Modifications to the Technologies

When you come across the situation where you need to use a different tool or solution than is provided in our [Approved Tools](/approved-tools.md) list, please read feel free to bring the matter up with the Standards &amp; Practices Board. This can be done via internal communication, GitHub Issue, or a Pull Request against this document. Before you do please follow the following processes:

### Process 1: Project Specific

When a developer feels they are unable to use an existing approved library, pattern, or framework for a needed solution, they must notify their project lead. In the case where there is no approved tools covering this type of problem and a new 3rd party library is to be used, they must also notify their project lead. If there are no approved tools for the problem, and they plan to code it themselves, no notification is needed (This covers the bulk of our creative effort at One North).

**Two steps:**

1. Give the project lead the following information (A formalized “heads-up” on the direction):
	* What approved solution (if any) would not work in this situation with brief reasoning on why it failed to meet the needs.
	* What direction the developer plans to take (Roll-your-own or new 3rd party framework)
	* If a 3rd party framework is to be used, provide relevant Source (Github/BitBucket/etc) and Website links to the project lead.

2. The project lead should provide immediate approval for the new direction unless:
	* They feel strongly an approved solution actually can (and thus should) be utilized.
	* The 3rd party framework’s license is incompatible with the project or unclear.

### Process 2: Permanent Addition to Approved Technology List

Our list of [approved technologies](/approved-tools.md) will change over time. When an One North developer would like to see a new technology added to the list, they must follow this process:

1. Create a new Issue in the Standards and Practices repo that should identify why they feel it should be added, how it differs from an existing tool (if there is one), and relevant links to source code, project website and existing documentation.
2. One North developers can discuss this addition in the pull request comments.
3. At least 3 developers, including 1 senior developer must be in support of the addition before serious attention will be paid to the issue.
4. Once the consensus seems to be in favor of addition, the S&P board will finalize the decision and report to the Issue.
5. At this point, it is up to original poster to add necessary documentation and example files and issue a pull request.
6. The final step, once all files are ready, is for a member of the S&P board to merge the request into the repository.
